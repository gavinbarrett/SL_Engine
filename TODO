-> Add documentation to the parser.py file
-> Pass .py files through pylint and work to remove errors
-> Make sure that empty inputs (such as collections of newlines and empty strings) cannot be passed through the lexer
-> Simplify API requests to one endpoint; require api call to contain a boolean to determine whether we return the truth tables or the validity tables
-> Simplify lexer and parser files, perhaps merging into one file; using a recursive descent parser gives us complete traversal abilities that may make our
in_order() function obsolete.
