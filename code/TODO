-> Fix square bracket error
-> print out trees by root
-> create method to print truth table and map to function :tt
-> create method to add propositions; add error checking to this
-> enable shell to retrieve history of past commands - use history.py or integrate into the shell, since we must keep track of commands
-> Check insertion algorithm; inserting on opposite side of the one desired.

-> Added evaluation and handle_root functions to the parser for printing the truth trees. Tree traversal seems to be looking nice; all we need is to generate values on the fly, determined by the logical expression, and evaluate all operators and terms, thus returning the value of the expression
-> fix evaluation function

--In regards to website functionality--
-> Fix front/back end lexers to not accept sequences of multiple terms or multiple operators. Also require one argument after negations [(,C,] and two after binary functions.

-> Change lexer to strip formulae that are just newlines ""
-> Change lexer to strip spaces from input formulae
